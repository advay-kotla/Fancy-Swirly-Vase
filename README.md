# Fancy-Swirly-Vase
The Holiday Twist Flower Pot, as described below, serves as a container for gifts and winter flower arrangements. This flower vase provides an outlet for small plants and winter flowers as a customized, 3D printed present during the Christmas holidays.

Project Summary

This focuses on the 3D printer flower pot that has been created specifically for the holiday season as an individualized present. This project represents my skills on advanced surface modeling, specifically the use of Loft Geometry, as well as aesthetically oriented engineering for FDM 3D printing. This design features an extremely dynamic, ridged, and twisted spiral shape.

Design and Geometry

The fundamental structure uses parametric modeling to provide stability and aesthetics. Some of the important aspects include:


- Fluted Structure: The body of the aircraft consists of four individual 16-sided polygons that are connected through the loft operation, thus creating the fluted design.
- Dynamic Twist. The exact 120-degree turn was performed around the central axis of the body. This created the spiral movement.

- Detailed Proportions: In the last model, the neck length was intentionally extended and later optimized for the production of well-proportioned and attractive medium-sized holiday flower vases and succulent planting containers.

Purpose and Functionality - Primary Use: As an attractive container for small plants, succulents, and flowers. - Esthetic Objective: The Red and Green stripe color scheme for the final design was utilized to link the pot directly to the Christmas period, making it an ever-ready and festive present.
