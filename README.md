# Fancy-Swirly-Vase
The Holiday Twist Flower Pot serves as a container for gifts and winter flower holders. This flower vase can have small plants and winter flowers as a customized, 3D printed present during the Christmas holidays.


This focuses on the 3D printer flower pot that has been created specifically for the holiday season as an individualized present. This project represents my skills on advanced surface modeling, specifically the use of Loft Geometry. This design features an extremely dynamic, ridged, and twisted spiral shape.

I made this as a gift to my neighbors as it is a very simple holiday gift to give during this season.
