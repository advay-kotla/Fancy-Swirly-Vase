# Fancy-Swirly-Vase
The Holiday Twist Flower Pot was designed with a purpose of serving as a distinctive and thoughtful container for Christmas gifts and holiday floral displays.  The vase's intended use is to hold small plants, succulents, or holiday flowers as a personalized, 3D-printed gift during the Christmas season. 


Project Summary

This project is a functional, 3D-printed flower pot designed specifically as a personalized gift for the Christmas season. It serves as an intensive study in advanced surface modeling (Loft Geometry) and aesthetic engineering for FDM printing. The design features a highly dynamic, ribbed structure with a dramatic spiral twist.

Design & Geometry

The core of the design is built using complex parametric modeling techniques to achieve both structural stability and visual appeal.Key FeaturesThe Fluted Structure: The body is defined by four separate 16-sided polygonal profiles connected via a Loft operation, creating the vertical fluting effect.Dynamic Twist: A precise $120^\circ$ rotation was applied across the central axis of the body to introduce a smooth, engaging spiral movement.Refined Proportions: The final model features an intentionally elongated neck (adjusted in the final hour) to create an elegant silhouette suitable for holding medium-sized holiday floral arrangements or succulents.Purpose and FunctionPrimary Use: A durable, decorative container for small plants, succulents, or flowers.Aesthetic Goal: The final Red and Green alternating color scheme was chosen to tie the pot directly to the Christmas season, making it a ready-to-use, festive gift.
